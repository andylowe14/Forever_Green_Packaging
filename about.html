  <h1>About <span class="accent">Forever Green Packaging</span></h1>
  <p>We're a sustainable packaging supplier founded on a simple idea: the benefits of modern packaging systems shouldn't only be available to big businesses with big budgets. Tom and the team are here to help businesses of all sizes pack greener, quicker and cheaper.</p>
</div></section>

<div class="seo-content">
  <h2>Our story</h2>
  <p>Forever Green Packaging was founded by Tom Elgood with a clear frustration and a clear mission. The frustration: that air cushion machines, paper void fill systems and other modern packaging equipment were locked behind minimum order quantities, high capital expenditure requirements and corporate sales processes that excluded small and medium-sized businesses. The mission: to change that.</p>

  <p>We've made it simple. You can buy a single machine, a single roll of film, or a single box of tape — no minimums, no long-term contracts, no account managers who never call back. You deal directly with Tom and the team, who know the products inside out and genuinely care about finding you the right solution, not just the most expensive one.</p>

  <h2>What makes us different</h2>

      <h3>Personal service from Tom</h3>
      <p>You're not a ticket number. When you call or email, you get Tom or a member of the small team who knows your business. We answer questions, give honest advice and sort problems quickly — because that's how we'd want to be treated.</p>

      <h3>No minimum orders</h3>
      <p>Buy one roll. Buy one machine. Buy one box of tape. We don't believe in forcing businesses to over-commit. Order what you need, when you need it, and we'll deliver it.</p>

      <h3>Genuinely affordable</h3>
      <p>Pound for pound, our machines are the cheapest online. But we're not cheap on quality — every machine comes with warranty, spare wearable parts and optional free installation. We've just cut out the overhead that inflates other suppliers' prices.</p>

      <h3>Actually sustainable</h3>
      <p>Not "sustainable" with an asterisk. Our films are 50% recycled content. Our Return 2 Recycle service closes the loop. We plant a tree with every order. We're specific about our environmental claims because vague greenwashing helps nobody.</p>

      <h3>Try before you buy</h3>
      <p>We'll repack one of your orders using our materials and send it back, free of charge, with a detailed comparison report. If our solution isn't better, we'll tell you honestly.</p>

  <h2>Who we work with</h2>
  <p>Forever Green Packaging serves businesses across a wide range of sectors. We supply e-commerce retailers, gift and homeware brands, food and drink companies, electronics distributors, pharmaceutical businesses, pet supply companies, building product suppliers, and many more. What they have in common is a need for reliable, affordable, sustainable protective packaging — and an appreciation for personal service.</p>

  <p>Whether you're packing 10 orders a day from your kitchen table or 10,000 from a distribution centre, we've got solutions and advice that fit. <a href="contact.html">Get in touch →</a></p>

  <h2>Green Packaging Pioneers</h2>
  <p>We describe ourselves as Green Packaging Pioneers because we believe in leading by example. That means being honest about the environmental trade-offs in different packaging materials, investing in genuinely recycled and recyclable products, running services like Return 2 Recycle that most suppliers can't be bothered with, and constantly educating our customers about what "sustainable" really means in practical terms.</p>

  <p>We're not perfect. No business is. But we're transparent about what we do and why, and we're committed to getting better. If that sounds like the kind of supplier you'd like to work with, <a href="contact.html">let's talk</a>.</p>
