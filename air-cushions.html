<!-- SEO CONTENT: WHAT IS AIR CUSHION PACKAGING -->
<div class="seo-content">
  <h2>What is air cushion packaging?</h2>
  <p>Air cushion packaging is a modern protective packaging method where a small desktop machine inflates rolls of lightweight plastic film into air-filled cushions, pillows, bubble quilts or tubes. These inflated cushions are then used inside boxes to protect products during shipping — filling empty space (void fill), wrapping fragile items, or cushioning products against impact.</p>

  <p>If you're currently using bubble wrap, loose fill peanuts, scrunched-up paper or foam chips to protect your products in transit, air cushion packaging does the same job — but faster, cheaper and with less storage space required. A single roll of flat film, about the size of a large kitchen roll, inflates into the equivalent of approximately 6 bags of loose fill. That's a genuine game-changer for businesses with limited warehouse space.</p>

  <h3>How does it work?</h3>
  <p>The process is simple. You load a roll of flat film into the machine, plug it in, and press start. The machine feeds the film through heated sealing bars while pumping air into each cushion. The inflated cushions come out on a continuous perforated strip — you just tear off what you need for each parcel. The whole process takes seconds, and most machines require zero training to operate. Plug and play, literally.</p>

  <h3>Who is air cushion packaging for?</h3>
  <p>Air cushion machines are used by businesses of all sizes across e-commerce, retail, logistics, pharmaceutical, electronics, gift and homeware sectors. They're particularly valuable for businesses that ship fragile or high-value items and want to reduce damage rates, or businesses that are looking to move away from bulky, space-consuming materials like loose fill or pre-made bubble wrap.</p>

  <p>If you're a startup or small business shipping even 5-10 parcels a day, an entry-level air cushion machine will pay for itself within weeks through material cost savings alone. If you're a larger operation, higher-speed models with accessories like winders and hopper trolleys can integrate into a fast-paced packing line.</p>

  <div class="content-cols">
    <div>
      <h3>Why air cushions beat traditional materials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Space saving:</strong> Film is stored flat on compact rolls. No more filling your warehouse with bags of loose fill or stacks of bubble wrap.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost effective:</strong> Material cost per parcel is significantly lower than pre-made bubble wrap, loose fill peanuts or foam packaging.</li>
        <li><strong>On demand:</strong> Produce exactly what you need, when you need it. Zero waste from overproduction.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> One machine can produce cushions for void fill, bubble for wrapping fragile items, and tubes for blocking and bracing.</li>
        <li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Air cushions add virtually no weight to your parcels, keeping shipping costs down.</li>
        <li><strong>Cleaner:</strong> No mess, no static, no loose fill escaping across your packing bench.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Environmental credentials</h3>
      <p>Forever Green air cushion films are made from 50% recycled content, which means 50% less virgin plastic is needed to produce each roll. Once inflated, the cushions are 99% air and just 1% material — it genuinely doesn't get much greener than packing with air.</p>
      <p>The films are 100% recyclable and exempt from the UK Plastic Packaging Tax (which applies to packaging with less than 30% recycled content). We also run a free Return 2 Recycle service: we send you prepaid mailers, you send back used film, and we ensure it's properly recycled.</p>
      <p>And with every order, we plant a tree through our partnership with Ecologi.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Frequently asked questions about air cushion packaging</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">What is an air cushion machine?</div>
      <div class="faq-a">An air cushion machine is a compact desktop device that inflates rolls of flat film into protective air-filled cushions, bubble wrap or tubes. You load a roll of film, plug it in, and it produces packaging on demand — meaning you only make what you need for each parcel. Our machines are plug-and-play, require no training, and come with a warranty and spare wearable parts.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">How much does an air cushion machine cost?</div>
      <div class="faq-a">Our machines are among the most affordable air cushion machines available in the UK, and the ongoing film costs are significantly lower than buying pre-made bubble wrap or loose fill. Most businesses recoup the machine cost within weeks.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Is air cushion film recyclable?</div>
      <div class="faq-a">Yes. Our films contain 50% recycled content and are 100% recyclable. They're exempt from the UK Plastic Packaging Tax. We also provide a free Return 2 Recycle service — we send you prepaid mailers and you send back used film for proper recycling.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">How do air cushions compare to bubble wrap?</div>
      <div class="faq-a">Air cushions provide equivalent or superior protection while requiring far less storage space. The film is stored flat and inflated on demand, so a compact roll replaces bulky pre-made bubble wrap. They're also faster to use — no cutting or tearing — and the 50% recycled content makes them more environmentally responsible than virgin bubble wrap.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Can I try before I buy?</div>
      <div class="faq-a">Absolutely. Send us one of your typical orders and we'll repack it using the best materials and methods. You'll receive your package back to experience the unboxing, plus a detailed comparison report covering pack cost, material weight, material type and more. It's completely free.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Do you have minimum order quantities?</div>
      <div class="faq-a">No. You can order a single roll of film or a single machine. We don't have minimum order quantities because we know that not every business ships by the thousand. Buy what you need, when you need it.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Can I rent or get a free loan machine?</div>
      <div class="faq-a">Yes — depending on your requirements, you can buy, rent or free-loan our machines. Contact Tom to discuss which option makes the most sense for your business.</div>
