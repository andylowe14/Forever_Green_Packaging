  <h2>What is protective packaging?</h2>
  <p>Protective packaging is any material used inside a shipping box to prevent the contents from being damaged during transit, storage or handling. It includes void fill (materials that fill empty space and stop products moving), cushioning (materials that absorb impact and shock), wrapping (materials that protect product surfaces from scratches and abrasion), and blocking and bracing (materials that hold products firmly in position).</p>

  <p>The right protective packaging depends on what you're shipping, how fragile it is, how far it's travelling, and what experience you want your customer to have when they open the box. A bottle of wine needs different protection from a laptop, which needs different protection from a candle, which needs different protection from a t-shirt. There's no one-size-fits-all answer — which is exactly why we offer multiple solutions and honest advice on which to use when.</p>

  <h2>Types of protective packaging we supply</h2>

  <div class="content-cols">
