<!-- WHY FGP - SEO CONTENT -->
<div class="seo-content">
  <h2>Why businesses choose Forever Green Packaging</h2>

  <p>Most packaging suppliers sell you materials. We help you find the right solution — and that's a genuinely different thing. Founded by Tom Elgood, Forever Green Packaging exists to make the benefits of modern packaging systems affordable and accessible to businesses of all sizes, not just the ones ordering by the pallet.</p>

  <p>Historically, air cushion machines, paper void fill systems and water-activated tape dispensers were only available to high-volume operations that could meet minimum order quantities and justify the capital expenditure. We changed that. You can buy a single roll of film, a single box of tape, or a machine that costs less than a decent office chair — and have it delivered next day with no minimum order.</p>

  <div class="content-cols">
    <div>
      <h3>Greener than you'd expect</h3>
      <p>Our air cushion films contain 50% recycled content and are 100% recyclable. When inflated, the actual packaging material is just 1% of the cushion — the other 99% is air. That means less raw material, less weight in transit, less waste at the other end, and exemption from the UK Plastic Packaging Tax.</p>
      <p>We also run a free Return 2 Recycle service. We send you prepaid mailers, you send back your used film, and we make sure it's properly recycled. Not many packaging suppliers do that.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Cheaper than you'd think</h3>
      <p>Pound for pound, our machines are the most affordable online. But the real savings come from the materials. A single 500m roll of air cushion film replaces approximately 6 bags of loose fill peanuts — that's a fraction of the cost per parcel, less storage space needed, and fewer reorders to manage.</p>
      <p>And because you produce cushions on demand, you only make what you need. No waste, no overstocking, no bins full of loose fill at the end of each day.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Quicker than your current method</h3>
  <p>If you're currently hand-tearing bubble wrap from a roll, scooping loose fill into boxes, or wrestling with cheap plastic tape that won't stick, you already know the pain. Our machines produce packaging in seconds — plug in, load a roll, and you're packing. Your team spends less time per parcel, which means more orders out the door and fewer late-afternoon panics.</p>
