  <h2>What is void fill packaging?</h2>
  <p>Void fill is any material used to fill the empty space between your product and the walls of the box it ships in. Without it, products shift during transit, collide with the sides of the box, and arrive damaged. The right void fill keeps everything snug, absorbs shocks and prevents movement — so your customers open their parcels to find exactly what they ordered, in perfect condition.</p>

  <p>The concept is simple, but choosing the right type of void fill for your business is where it gets interesting. Different materials suit different products, different volumes and different budgets. A gift company shipping fragile ceramics has very different needs from an electronics retailer shipping headphones, even though both need void fill.</p>

  <h2>Types of void fill packaging</h2>
  <p>There are five main categories of void fill packaging, each with distinct advantages and trade-offs. Here's an honest breakdown.</p>

  <h3>1. Air cushion packaging (air pillows, inflatable cushions)</h3>
  <p>Air cushion packaging uses a small machine to inflate rolls of lightweight film into air-filled pillows, quilts or tubes. These inflated cushions fill the voids in your boxes, absorbing impact and preventing products from moving. The film is stored flat on compact rolls and inflated on demand, which means minimal storage space compared to pre-made packaging materials.</p>
  <p>Forever Green's air cushion films are made from 50% recycled content and are 100% recyclable. When inflated, the cushion is 99% air and just 1% material — making it one of the most resource-efficient packaging options available.</p>
  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> E-commerce businesses, fragile items, operations that need speed and consistency, businesses with limited storage space.</p>
  <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Low per-parcel cost after initial machine investment (see our shop for current pricing). One 500m roll replaces approximately 6 bags of loose fill.</p>

  <h3>2. Paper void fill</h3>
  <p>Paper void fill systems use dispensers to convert rolls of kraft or recycled paper into crumpled, padded or fan-folded protective material. Manual dispensers require no power — just pull the paper through and tear off what you need. Automatic dispensers use a foot pedal or button for faster output, and padded paper systems create 3D cushioned pads for superior protection of fragile items.</p>
  <p>Paper void fill is 100% recyclable and biodegradable, making it a popular choice for businesses whose customers prioritise plastic-free packaging. It's also extremely versatile — you can scrunch it loosely for general void fill or wrap it tightly around products for cushioning.</p>
  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses wanting completely plastic-free packaging, gift and premium brands where presentation matters, fragile items that need wrapping.</p>
  <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Moderate per-parcel cost. See our shop for current dispenser pricing.</p>

  <h3>3. Loose fill (packing peanuts, chips)</h3>
  <p>Loose fill — those familiar packing peanuts — is poured into a box to fill the gaps around your product. Modern versions are typically made from biodegradable starch rather than polystyrene, which is an improvement on the environmental front. However, loose fill has some well-known practical drawbacks: it's messy, it creates static, it requires significant storage space, it settles during transit (meaning the product can shift), and customers generally dislike dealing with it at the other end.</p>
  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Irregularly shaped items where other void fill is impractical, very low-volume operations where a machine investment doesn't make sense.</p>
  <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Moderate, but storage costs and waste make the true cost higher than it appears.</p>

  <h3>4. Bubble wrap</h3>
  <p>Traditional bubble wrap provides good cushioning for fragile items. However, it's bulky to store, typically made from virgin plastic, and increasingly viewed negatively by environmentally conscious consumers. Paper-based bubble wrap alternatives are now available, offering similar cushioning from recyclable materials.</p>
  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Surface wrapping of fragile items, though air cushion bubble film or paper alternatives now offer equivalent protection with better environmental credentials.</p>

  <h3>5. Foam packaging</h3>
  <p>Foam-in-place and pre-cut foam inserts offer premium protection for high-value or extremely fragile items. However, they're expensive, not recyclable in most cases, and only practical for businesses shipping the same product repeatedly (since inserts are custom-shaped).</p>
  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> High-value electronics, medical devices, precision instruments — items where the cost of damage far exceeds the cost of premium packaging.</p>

  <h2>How to choose the right void fill for your business</h2>
  <p>The honest answer is that it depends on what you're shipping, how many parcels you send, how much space you have, and what matters most to your customers. Here's a quick decision framework:</p>

  <table class="compare-table">
    <thead>
      <tr><th>If you need...</th><th>Consider...</th><th>Why</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Speed and low cost at volume</td><td><a href="air-cushions.html">Air cushion machines</a></td><td>Fastest packing, lowest per-parcel cost, minimal storage</td></tr>
      <tr><td>100% plastic-free packaging</td><td><a href="protective-paper.html">Paper void fill systems</a></td><td>Recyclable, biodegradable, great unboxing presentation</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Both void fill and fragile item wrapping</td><td><a href="air-cushions.html">Air cushion bubble film</a></td><td>Bubble quilts wrap fragile items; pillows fill voids — one machine does both</td></tr>
      <tr><td>A solution with zero upfront investment</td><td>Loose fill or manual paper</td><td>No machine needed, though per-parcel costs are higher</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Premium presentation for gifts</td><td><a href="protective-paper.html">Honeycomb or tissue paper</a></td><td>Looks beautiful in the box while still protecting the contents</td></tr>
