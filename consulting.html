  <h2>How we help</h2>
  <p>Our consultancy isn't theoretical. Tom and the team come to your site, understand your operation, and work with you to find practical improvements. We've helped businesses across e-commerce, retail, logistics and industrial sectors reduce packaging costs, improve sustainability credentials and streamline packing workflows.</p>

  <div class="feature-grid">
    <div class="feature-box"><h3>Benchmarking</h3><p>We assess your current packaging against best practice and competitor standards. Where are you overspending? Where are you under-protecting? Where could a material change save money and improve quality?</p></div>
    <div class="feature-box"><h3>Material Change</h3><p>Moving from one packaging material to another — whether for cost, sustainability or performance reasons — needs careful planning. We manage the transition to ensure protection quality is maintained while costs come down.</p></div>
    <div class="feature-box"><h3>Sustainability & Carbon Reporting</h3><p>We help you measure, report and improve the environmental impact of your packaging. From carbon footprint calculations to waste reduction targets, we provide the data and the roadmap.</p></div>
    <div class="feature-box"><h3>Pack Value Analysis</h3><p>We analyse every component of your packaging to identify where you're over-engineering (spending more than necessary) and where you're under-protecting (risking damage). The goal is optimal protection at minimum cost.</p></div>
    <div class="feature-box"><h3>Time & Motion Studies</h3><p>How long does each packer spend per order? Where are the bottlenecks? We observe your packing line, measure performance and recommend changes that increase throughput without increasing headcount.</p></div>
    <div class="feature-box"><h3>Staff Training</h3><p>New materials and equipment only work if your team knows how to use them. We provide hands-on training on packing techniques, machine operation and quality standards.</p></div>
    <div class="feature-box"><h3>Supplier Management</h3><p>If you're using multiple packaging suppliers, we can help rationalise and consolidate — reducing complexity, improving buying power and simplifying your supply chain.</p></div>
    <div class="feature-box"><h3>Custom Packaging Design</h3><p>For businesses that need bespoke boxes, branded tape or custom-sized packaging, we handle design, sourcing and production management.</p></div>
    <div class="feature-box"><h3>Automation</h3><p>For high-volume operations, we assess where automation can replace manual processes — from automatic tape dispensers to integrated air cushion systems — and manage the implementation.</p></div>
  </div>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>It starts with a conversation. Tell us about your packaging challenges, your volumes, your goals and your pain points. We'll suggest a scope of work and, if it makes sense for both sides, visit your site to see the operation firsthand. From there, we provide recommendations, help implement changes, and measure the results. No jargon, no overblown proposals — just practical help from people who know packaging inside out.</p>

  <div class="cta-banner">
    <h2>Let's talk about your packaging</h2>
    <p>Whether you're looking to cut costs, go greener, speed up your packing line or all three — we'd love to help. The conversation is free and there's no obligation.</p>
