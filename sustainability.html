  <h1>Our Approach to <span class="accent">Sustainability</span></h1>
  <p>We're specific about our environmental claims because vague greenwashing helps nobody. Here's exactly what we do, why we do it, and what it actually means for the environment.</p>
</div></section>

<div class="seo-content">
  <h2>What we actually do</h2>

      <h3>50% recycled content</h3>
      <p>Our air cushion films are manufactured using 50% post-consumer recycled plastic. That means every roll requires 50% less virgin raw material. These films are exempt from the UK Plastic Packaging Tax (which applies to packaging containing less than 30% recycled content). Given that only about 15% of plastic in the UK gets recycled, using 50% recycled content represents approximately a 15% improvement in raw material consumption even if the end product isn't recycled — though we strongly encourage that it is.</p>

      <div class="icon">🔄</div>
      <h3>Return 2 Recycle</h3>
      <p>We provide free recycling mailers with pre-paid postage. You send back your used air cushion film, and we ensure it's collected and properly recycled through established recycling streams. This isn't a token gesture — it's a genuine closed-loop service that makes recycling as easy as putting film in an envelope and dropping it in a post box. We also encourage end consumers to recycle via local recycling points at recyclenow.com.</p>

      <h3>Tree planting partnership</h3>
      <p>Through our partnership with Ecologi, we plant a tree with every order placed. Trees absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and provide habitat for wildlife. It's not a substitute for reducing our environmental impact at source (which we do through material innovation and waste reduction), but it's a meaningful additional contribution.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-box">
      <div class="icon">💨</div>
      <h3>99% air, 1% material</h3>
      <p>An inflated air cushion is 99% air by volume. The actual plastic content is approximately 1%. That makes air cushion packaging one of the most material-efficient forms of protection available. You're protecting your products with air — there's not much greener than that.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-box">
      <div class="icon">📉</div>
      <h3>On-demand = zero waste</h3>
      <p>Because our machines produce packaging on demand, you make exactly what you need for each parcel. There are no offcuts, no oversized pre-cut sheets, no half-used bags of loose fill going stale. On-demand production is inherently waste-reducing.</p>
    </div>

      <h3>Paper alternatives</h3>
      <p>For businesses that want to eliminate plastic entirely, we supply paper void fill systems and gummed paper tapes that are 100% recyclable, biodegradable and FSC certified. Our paper products go straight into standard paper recycling — no special handling, no confusion.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Our sustainability commitments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Price & product guarantee:</strong> We stand behind the quality and value of every product we sell.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We're specific about recycled content percentages, recyclability claims and environmental credentials. We don't hide behind vague terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> We're always looking for ways to increase recycled content, reduce waste and improve the environmental performance of our products.</li>
    <li><strong>Education:</strong> We help our customers understand what "sustainable packaging" actually means in practical terms, including the trade-offs involved in different material choices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The honest picture on plastics vs paper</h2>
  <p>There's a common assumption that paper is always greener than plastic. The reality is more nuanced. Lifecycle analyses show that some plastic packaging — particularly lightweight, high-recycled-content plastic like our air cushion films — can have a lower carbon footprint than heavier paper alternatives, because less material is used and less energy is required in production and transport.</p>

  <p>We sell both plastic and paper solutions because we believe businesses should have accurate information and make their own choices. If paper is the right fit for your brand and customers, we'll supply excellent paper products. If recycled plastic air cushions are more efficient for your operation, we'll supply those. We're not dogmatic about materials — we're practical about finding the most genuinely sustainable solution for each situation.</p>
