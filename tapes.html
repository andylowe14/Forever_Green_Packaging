  <h1>Gummed Paper Tape & <span class="accent">Water Activated Tape Dispensers</span></h1>
  <p>The strongest, most secure, most sustainable way to seal a cardboard box. Gummed paper tape creates a permanent bond with cardboard, is fully recyclable with the box, and is tamper-evident. No more peeling plastic tape.</p>

<div class="seo-content">
  <h2>What is gummed paper tape?</h2>
  <p>Gummed paper tape — also known as water-activated tape, WAT, or kraft paper tape — is a paper-based sealing tape coated with a starch-based adhesive that activates when moistened with water. When applied to cardboard, the adhesive soaks into the fibres of the box, creating a permanent bond that's significantly stronger than pressure-sensitive plastic tape. You can't peel it off without visibly damaging the box, which makes it inherently tamper-evident.</p>

  <p>If you've ever received a parcel from Amazon, Apple or any number of major retailers and noticed the brown paper tape that tears with the cardboard when you open it — that's gummed paper tape. It's the industry standard for secure, sustainable box sealing, and it's now affordable enough for businesses of any size.</p>

  <h3>Why switch from plastic tape to gummed paper tape?</h3>

  <div class="content-cols">
    <div>
      <h3>Stronger seal</h3>
      <p>Plastic tape sits on the surface of the box. Gummed tape bonds into the cardboard fibres. That's a fundamentally different kind of seal — one that gets stronger as it dries, doesn't peel in cold or damp conditions, and doesn't require multiple strips to hold a heavy box shut. One strip of reinforced gummed tape across a box seam is typically stronger than three strips of plastic tape.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Fully recyclable</h3>
      <p>Here's something most people don't realise: when you stick plastic tape on a cardboard box, the entire box technically becomes mixed-material waste. Most recycling facilities can handle small amounts of plastic tape, but it reduces the quality of the recycled cardboard. Gummed paper tape goes straight through the recycling process with the box — no separation needed, no quality reduction. Your customers' boxes are truly single-material, single-stream recyclable.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Tamper evidence</h3>
  <p>Gummed tape can't be cleanly removed and reapplied. Any tampering is immediately obvious because the tape tears the cardboard surface when someone tries to peel it. For businesses shipping valuable or sensitive products, this is a meaningful security feature that plastic tape simply doesn't offer.</p>

  <p>Standard gummed tape is strong enough for most applications. Reinforced tape has fibreglass threads running through it for extra tensile strength — use it on heavier boxes or where you need absolute confidence in the seal.</p>

  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-q">Do I need a dispenser to use gummed tape?</div>
    <div class="faq-a">Technically you can wet the tape with a sponge and apply it by hand, but a dispenser makes the process far faster and more consistent. Even our most basic manual dispenser pays for itself quickly in time savings.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-q">Is gummed tape more expensive than plastic tape?</div>
    <div class="faq-a">The tape itself is comparable in cost. The difference is the dispenser — you need a water-activated tape dispenser rather than a simple hand roller. But since you typically need fewer strips of gummed tape per box (one strip vs two or three), the ongoing cost is similar or even lower.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-q">Can I get custom printed gummed tape?</div>
    <div class="faq-a">Yes — we offer custom printed gummed paper tape with your branding, logo or messaging. It's a great way to enhance the unboxing experience while keeping your packaging fully recyclable. <a href="contact.html">Contact us for custom tape enquiries.</a></div>
