  <h1>Eco-Friendly Packaging: <span class="accent">Greener, Quicker & Cheaper</span></h1>
  <p>Sustainable packaging doesn't have to cost more or work less well. In fact, the most environmentally responsible options are often the most cost-effective and space-efficient too. Here's how to green your packaging without compromising on protection or blowing your budget.</p>
</div></section>

<div class="seo-content">
  <h2>The truth about sustainable packaging</h2>
  <p>Let's cut through the noise. "Eco-friendly packaging" has become such a broad term that it's almost meaningless without specifics. A product labelled "eco" could be made from 5% recycled content or 100%. It could be technically recyclable but only at specialist facilities that don't exist in most UK towns. It could be "compostable" but only in industrial composting conditions that your customers don't have access to.</p>

  <p>At Forever Green Packaging, we prefer to be specific about what "eco-friendly" actually means for each of our products, and honest about the trade-offs involved in every material choice. No greenwashing, no vague claims — just clear information so you can make informed decisions.</p>

  <h2>How we make packaging genuinely greener</h2>

      <h3>50% recycled content films</h3>
      <p>Our air cushion films are manufactured from 50% post-consumer recycled plastic. That's 50% less virgin material per roll. These films are exempt from the UK Plastic Packaging Tax (which applies to packaging with less than 30% recycled content), saving you money too.</p>

    <div class="feature-box">
      <div class="icon">📦</div>
      <h3>100% recyclable materials</h3>
      <p>Every product we sell is recyclable. Our air cushion films can be recycled at standard plastic collection points. Our paper products go straight in the paper recycling bin. Our gummed paper tape recycles with the cardboard box it's stuck to — no separation needed.</p>

      <div class="icon">🔄</div>
      <h3>Return 2 Recycle service</h3>
      <p>We send you prepaid mailers, you send back your used air cushion film, and we ensure it's properly recycled. It's free, it's easy, and it closes the loop on packaging waste in a way that most suppliers don't even attempt.</p>

      <h3>One tree per order</h3>
      <p>Through our partnership with Ecologi, we plant a tree with every order placed. It's a small thing, but small things add up — and it's a genuine investment in carbon offset, not a marketing gimmick.</p>

      <h3>99% air, 1% material</h3>
      <p>An inflated air cushion is 99% air and 1% plastic film. That's the most resource-efficient form of protective packaging that exists. You're literally packing with nothing — and that nothing does a brilliant job of protecting your products.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-box">
      <div class="icon">📉</div>
      <h3>Less material overall</h3>
      <p>Because air cushions are produced on demand, you make exactly what you need for each parcel. No offcuts, no oversized sheets, no half-used bags of loose fill going stale in the corner. Less waste by design.</p>
    </div>

  <h2>Choosing the right eco-friendly packaging for your business</h2>
  <p>The "greenest" option depends on what matters most to your business and your customers. Here's an honest breakdown.</p>

  <h3>If your priority is lowest environmental impact per parcel...</h3>
  <p><a href="air-cushions.html">Air cushion packaging</a> wins. The combination of 50% recycled content, minimal material usage (99% air), on-demand production (zero waste), and full recyclability makes it the most resource-efficient protective packaging available. Yes, it's still plastic — but it's recycled plastic used in the most efficient way possible.</p>

  <h3>If your priority is plastic-free packaging...</h3>
  <p><a href="protective-paper.html">Paper void fill</a> and <a href="tapes.html">gummed paper tape</a> give you a completely plastic-free packaging line. Paper rolls, paper cushions, paper tape — everything goes in your customer's paper recycling bin. Combined with a cardboard box, your entire parcel is single-material and infinitely recyclable.</p>

  <h3>If your priority is what your customers want to see...</h3>
  <p>Most consumer research shows that customers perceive paper as more environmentally friendly than plastic, even when the lifecycle analysis is more nuanced than that. If your brand positioning depends on visible eco credentials and customer perception, paper-based packaging makes strategic sense regardless of the technical comparison.</p>

  <h3>If you want the best of both worlds...</h3>
  <p>Many of our customers use air cushion pillows for general void fill (because they're fast and cost-effective) and paper for wrapping and presentation (because it looks and feels premium). You can also use gummed paper tape to seal the box, making the entire customer-facing experience plastic-free while keeping the cost-efficient air cushions hidden inside as functional void fill.</p>

  <h2>The UK Plastic Packaging Tax — what you need to know</h2>
  <p>Since April 2022, the UK Plastic Packaging Tax applies to plastic packaging manufactured in or imported into the UK that contains less than 30% recycled content. The tax is currently £217.85 per tonne. Because Forever Green's air cushion films contain 50% recycled content, they're fully exempt from this tax — which is a real cost saving for businesses using significant volumes of plastic packaging.</p>

  <p>If you're currently using virgin plastic bubble wrap, loose fill, or air pillows from suppliers who don't meet the 30% threshold, you may be paying more than you need to. <a href="contact.html">Talk to Tom about switching →</a></p>
